### Analysis Notes:
- **High Probability (85-99%)**: Companies already deeply integrated with AI technologies or those whose core offerings are inherently AI-driven (like OpenAI, Databricks, Scale AI) have the highest potential for conversion.
- **Moderate Probability (70-84%)**: Platforms with strong data infrastructure, automation capabilities, or customer engagement components can be adapted with additional AI agent orchestration layers.
- **Lower Probability (65-69%)**: Companies in more specialized or niche markets may face challenges in implementing full AI agent orchestration systems due to specific industry requirements or less straightforward workflow integration.
