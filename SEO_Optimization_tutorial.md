2. Semantic HTML structure
3. Image optimization
4. Performance aspects
5. Mobile responsiveness
6. Structured data
7. Any robots.txt and sitemap.xml files in the public directory</think>Now I'll look at the key files that affect SEO in this Next.js project. Let's first examine the app/layout.tsx file as it likely contains important metadata configuration:

<think>I need to analyze this codebase for SEO optimization. So far I've learned this is a Next.js application for a website related to Mermaid diagrams (based on the components in page.tsx).

Let me continue the audit by examining more components and checking for critical SEO elements. I should look at:

1. The Home component referenced in layout.tsx
2. Check for any SEO-specific components or metadata handling
3. Look at the public directory for robots.txt and sitemap.xml
4. Check the components directory for any header/navbar components where there might be SEO-relevant elements
5. Assess Next.js configuration for SEO settings

Let me start by looking at the Home component referenced in the layout.tsx:</think>I'll continue with my SEO audit of your Mermaid diagram website at mermaid.evooque.com. Let's examine the Home component first, as it's referenced in the layout.tsx file:

So far I've found:
1. This is a Next.js project (indicated by Next.js specific files and directories)
2. The app/layout.tsx file has very basic metadata:
   - Title: "Create Next App" (generic)
   - Description: "Generated by create next app" (generic)
3. The app/page.tsx shows this is a Mermaid diagram rendering application
4. The Home component is simple and doesn't contain SEO-specific elements

Let me continue checking key SEO elements. I need to look at:

1. Public directory to check for robots.txt and sitemap.xml
2. Component files related to headers, navigation, etc.
3. Any additional metadata configurations
4. Image optimization practices
5. HTML structure and semantic markup

Let me check the public directory first to see if there are SEO-related files:</think>Now I need to check your public directory for important SEO files like robots.txt and sitemap.xml:

<think>Now that I've explored several key files and directories in this codebase, I can prepare a comprehensive SEO audit for the Mermaid diagram website (mermaid.evooque.com). Let me organize what I've found and identify SEO issues and opportunities.

Key findings from the codebase analysis:

1. This is a Next.js application focused on rendering Mermaid diagrams
2. The metadata in layout.tsx is generic:
   - Title: "Create Next App"
   - Description: "Generated by create next app"
3. There are no SEO-specific files in the public directory (no robots.txt or sitemap.xml)
4. The Next.js configuration doesn't include specific SEO optimizations
5. The application appears to be primarily a client-side tool with minimal content structure

Based on this information, I'll need to provide a detailed SEO audit report with actionable recommendations. I'll structure my findings around key SEO areas.</think># SEO Audit Report for mermaid.evooque.com

After examining your codebase, I've identified several SEO opportunities and areas for improvement. Here's a detailed analysis with actionable recommendations:

## 1. Metadata Configuration

**Current Status:**
- Generic title: "Create Next App"
- Generic description: "Generated by create next app"
- No custom meta tags for social sharing
- No canonical URLs configured

**Recommendations:**
- Update the metadata in `app/layout.tsx` with a descriptive title that includes keywords related to Mermaid diagrams
- Create a compelling meta description (150-160 characters) that explains the purpose of your tool
- Implement Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags for better social media sharing
- Add canonical URLs to prevent duplicate content issues

```tsx:app/layout.tsx
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Mermaid Diagram Generator | Create and Share Diagrams Online",
  description: "Free online tool to create, edit and share Mermaid diagrams for flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, and more. No installation required.",
  openGraph: {
    title: "Mermaid Diagram Generator | Create and Share Diagrams Online",
    description: "Create professional diagrams easily with our free online Mermaid editor",
    url: "https://mermaid.evooque.com",
    siteName: "Mermaid Diagram Tool",
    images: [
      {
        url: "https://mermaid.evooque.com/og-image.jpg",
        width: 1200,
        height: 630,
      }
    ],
    locale: "en_US",
    type: "website",
  },
  // Additional metadata configurations
};
```

## 2. Missing SEO Essentials

**Current Status:**
- No robots.txt file
- No sitemap.xml
- No structured data

**Recommendations:**
- Create a `robots.txt` file in the public directory to guide search engine crawlers
- Generate a sitemap.xml to help search engines discover and index your pages
- Implement structured data (JSON-LD) to enhance search results appearance

```
# Example robots.txt to add to public directory
User-agent: *
Allow: /
Sitemap: https://mermaid.evooque.com/sitemap.xml
```

## 3. HTML Structure and Semantics

**Current Status:**
- Limited semantic HTML elements
- Basic document structure

- Add accessible ARIA attributes where appropriate

## 4. Performance Optimization

**Current Status:**
- Client-side rendering for the main application
- No visible image optimization strategies
- No configuration for Core Web Vitals optimization

**Recommendations:**
- Implement Next.js Image component for all images to improve loading performance
- Configure dynamic imports for heavy components
- Add preconnect and dns-prefetch for external resources
- Consider implementing static generation for suitable pages

## 5. Mobile Responsiveness

**Current Status:**
- Basic responsive styling with Tailwind CSS
- No specific mobile optimizations observed

**Recommendations:**
- Ensure the diagram editor is fully responsive across all device sizes
- Implement mobile-specific UI improvements for better usability
- Add the viewport meta tag if not already present

## 6. Content Strategy

- Focus on functionality with minimal descriptive content
- Limited keyword optimization

**Recommendations:**
- Add informative content explaining Mermaid diagrams and use cases
- Create tutorial sections with relevant keywords
- Consider a blog section with Mermaid diagram tips and examples
- Add alt text to all images and SVGs

## 7. Technical SEO

- No visible error handling or 404 page customization
- Minimal URL structure optimization

**Recommendations:**
- Create a custom 404 page with helpful navigation
- Implement proper URL structure for any additional pages
- Configure proper status codes for all responses
- Add a service worker for offline capabilities and improved performance
